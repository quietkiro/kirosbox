# Recap

As of last Wednesday, the 4-week v0.1.0 challenge ended. The last week of the challenge was particularly hard as I had very few people to talk to, so it was pretty lonely. I realize that my social health definitely needs to be accounted for, but I'm not sure how to tackle it yet.

Goal progress:
- No YT/IG - 7/7 (ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸)
- Bed by midnight - 7/7(ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸ðŸ—¸)

## Quick Reflection

Cutting out social media was actually not hard past the first couple weeks. However, getting into bed by midnight was quite a loose goal, since I was still free to use my phone. That said, since I couldn't access social media, it did help push my bedtime from about 4-5 AM to 1-2 AM, which is a big improvement. However, the bedtime variation is still about 1-2 hours, which is not ideal.

Overall, I think I met all the goals I had set for v0.1.0, so I think it's time to move on to v0.2.0.

As for why this post is being made on a Saturday rather than a Wednesday, it's because of two reasons:
- I think Saturdays are an ideal day to reflect, as I usually don't have commitments to tend to (which is not the case for Wednesdays).
- I thought a couple days' break from all the restrictions I set would be nice, just to catch up on things I missed. Of course, those restrictions are to be applied again for v0.2.0.
# Next Goal

This time around, the goal is to set a routine. Since I plan to pursue getting things done, I'm sure I will disappoint myself in the process at some point. To stop one bad day from causing the following week to spiral, I think setting a routine would allow me to prevent future failures from affecting other parts of my life and causing me to spiral.

As for the types of elements I want to incorporate into my routine, I mainly want to incorporate better hygiene, better cleanliness, meditation, and better sleep hygiene. However, instead of doing this over another 4-week period, I would like to try cutting it down to 2-week cycles as I noticed I had gotten used to things by the end of the 2nd week during v0.1.0.

In summary, the new goals for the next two weeks are:
- Brush teeth with an electric toothbrush properly (~3-4 min), both in the morning and at night.
	- Allowed to skip 4 times to meet goal
- Get into bed by midnight without checking my phone for anything more than the time.
	- Allowed to skip 4 times to meet goal
- Meditate using the focusing on one thing method (be it breathing or staring at a single point) for 5 minutes, once daily.
	- Allowed to skip 4 times to meet goal
- Clean at least one drawer a week.
	- No skipping allowed to meet goal
- Shower before 8 PM, daily.
	- Allowed to do later in the day only twice during these two weeks to meet goal
- No social media (specifically IG/YT)
	- No skipping allowed to meet goal

# Updates

Like last time, updates will be posted here weekly. However, the final week's entry will be put here as well, with the next version's post including more of an overall recap than a final-week-recap.

Updates will be posted every Saturday.
